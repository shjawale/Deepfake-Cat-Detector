# Deepfake-Cat-Detector

In this assignment I implemented some classifiers to predict whether or not images of cats are "deepfakes", i.e., generated by AI. I used PyTorch, HuggingFace "transformers" library for getting pretrained models, scikit-learn (for cross validation utility and for baseline logistic regression), matplotlib for visualization. It was completed on both Google Colab and my local Linux machine using ipython3.

The training and validation results I got with 5-fold cross-validation for each learning rate value:
